I am Currently pursuing my masters in Northwest Missouri State University.

My Interests are exploring new places and watching cricket.

I Completed my Graduation in VNRVJIET in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. 

During my Undergraduation I have Electives like C and Java , after studying those electives ,I got 
interest in those subjects .

 I wanted to enhance my skills in coding , so I joined in Applied Computer Science.
